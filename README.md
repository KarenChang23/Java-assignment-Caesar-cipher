  e.g. with a shift of 3, A -> D,  H -> K,  X -> A,  and Z -> C

Write a console program that reads a message from the user, performs a Caesar cipher on its letters with a shift of 2 (shift only two letters , leave other characters alone), and outputs the encoded message.

For instance:
When user inputs a message: i love clu 

Since the shift is 2, 

The output(encoded message) should be: k nqxg enw
